## Cristhiam Daniel Campos Julca

Data Engineer and Artificial Intelligence Engineer with a strong background in applied mathematics and systems engineering.  
I am an Industrial Mechanical Engineer, M.Sc. in Applied Mathematics, and Ph.D. candidate in Engineering (Automation), with professional experience in data-driven architectures, backend systems, and AI-enabled platforms.

My profile combines rigorous analytical training with hands-on software development, allowing me to design, implement, and operate scalable data and AI solutions in both public-sector and private environments.

I work at the intersection of **data engineering, artificial intelligence, and distributed systems**, focusing on real-world, production-oriented solutions rather than experimental prototypes.
